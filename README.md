# comfort2mqtt - A Comfort alarm panel / MQTT bridge

This project's goal is to provide a simple Comfort/MQTT bridge (via a Comfort serial UCM) that supports communication in both directions with the Comfort alarm panel.

The ultimate goal is to provide access to most of the [Comfort serial protocol](http://www.cytech.biz/serial_interface_protocol.html) functionality via an MQTT server, so that it can be integrated into home automation systems such as [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).

It is currently very much a work in progress.

If you have a Home Assistant installation and want to use this project as an add-on to home assistant,
then you can go [here][comfort2mqtt-doc] for the add-on documentation.
